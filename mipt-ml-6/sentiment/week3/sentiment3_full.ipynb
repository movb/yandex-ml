      "0: 6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice . \n",

      "0: it 's perfect for those who aren 't planning on storing tons of music .\n",
      "0: this simple nuance was too much for nokia , and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free .\n",
      "0: the box included a little polyester , pull-string bag , ( yes , you read right a bag , something a boy would carry ten marbles in ) and tries to pass it off as the case .\n",

      "1: the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on . \n",
      "0: 2 ) scroll button / switch \n",
      "0: overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occassion .\n",

      "0: another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function .\n",

      "0: 1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) \n",

      "0: this is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment .\n",
      "0: i thought given all the \" 10 \" reviews about this camera that i would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey .\n",
      "0: 4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras . \n",
      "0: problems with the sound quality were evident right away , but even i couldn 't imagine they 'd be that bad .\n",
      "0: i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . \n",
      "1: the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! \n",
      "0: i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work . \n",
      "0: you can 't do that with a sony t610 ( which i traded for a 6600 ) .\n",

      "0: i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died . \n",
      "0: deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ). \n",
      "1: i don 't have problems with the depth adjustment , the speed control , the collet ( i haven 't tried the 1 / 4 \" sleeve yet ) .\n",

      "1: the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative . \n",
      "0: after 4 attempted installs , i have finally given up .\n",
      "0: there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! \n",
      "0: i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture .\n",
      "1: it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing .\n",
      "0: the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb . \n",
      "1: 2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons . \n",
      "0: knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it .\n",
      "0: my friend has an ipod , and although the sound quality probably won 't meet most audiophile standards , the product itself is better than anything creative has made .\n",
      "0: in addition , i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours , and it can take four hours for a full charge .\n",
      "0: the number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area , the fonts are small , the interface is too convoluted and frustrating , it 's not that customisable as well .\n",
      "0: the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered , and excludes my favorite feature in itunes , the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder .\n",
      "0: for example , in auto mode you can 't use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that .\n",
      "0: when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture ! \n",
      "0: as i wrote , this could have been a great product , but expect hidden charges ( read gross profiteering and price gouging ) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage .\n",
      "0: however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality . \n",
      "0: the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds . \n",
      "0: also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 \" tv ). \n",
      "0: apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands . \n",
      "1: the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don 't need to fuss with a lens cap .\n",
      "0: the only disappointment so far has been battery life .\n",
      "0: after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn 't do anything but turn on my player .\n",
      "0: i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it .\n",
      "0: it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . \n",
      "0: the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display . \n",
      "0: i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode . \n",
      "0: that 's when it went from oderless , to oderous !\n",
      "1: fm tuner & microphone : having a tuner in the player is a blessing .\n",
      "1: i don 't believe this camera is still available . but if you can find one , you might like to get it .\n",
      "0: the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card , first thing !\n",
      "0: the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use . \n",
      "0: for purposes of clarity , here is my review from that product , edited to be appropriate for this product , since , for the most part , they share many of the same problems .\n",
      "0: the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating . \n",
      "0: first , let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas , and i most likely would not have spent the $ 300 myself .\n",
      "1: you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right . \n",
      "0: t-mobile wasn 't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate .\n",
      "0: too bad they don 't mention anything about how the cd can 't be used with a mac .\n",
      "0: a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine . \n",
      "0: it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working . \n",
      "0: to use the creative zen player with a subscription service , you need to go to creative 's web site , and download new software for your pc .\n",
      "0: doesn 't have alot of good games on it .\n",
      "0: only thing missing from creative is a cd burner . \n",
      "1: by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do .\n",
      "1: the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle . \n",
      "0: this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people .\n",
      "0: well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . \n",
      "0: one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved .\n",
      "0: if someone asked me flat out , i 'd say to go woth something else .\n",
      "0: the movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160x120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640x480 .\n",
      "0: linksys is more costlier than others and is a home / consumer division of cisco .\n",
      "1: also , the display is \" hinged \" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage . \n",
      "0: this is not a router i would suggest for a novice user , my old dlink di52 !\n",
      "0: i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments , but i seldom use it .\n",
      "1: there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched .\n",
      "0: 3- it is slow , if you keep the original configuration and progs ( why 'd u buy it then ? ! ) it 'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen nokias .\n",
      "0: the fact that the \" 0 \" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the \" # \" key instead . \n",
      "0: the plunge action isn 't smooth unless you make it so .\n",
      "0: respectable , solid , but not awe-inspiring .\n",
      "0: i gave up and got a diaper dekor .\n",
      "0: its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily , not great from a cosmetic standpoint .\n",
      "1: however , there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd ( and online ) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro .\n",
      "0: another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads. charging [ -2 ] # # also note that it doesn 't seem to charge when connected to the pc , only when plugged into an ac socket even though they both connect to the single usb port on the player , so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music .\n",
      "0: a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy .\n"
